The aim of this addon/patch is to make Clusterfuck4.3+ compatible with the Guncaster mod and GC_Addon.

While most of the things in this patch are modifications of the original Gc actors, some stuff, including
graphics and modification to the HUD and the proper zscript death/money adapter are an exclusive content 
created by TonynUBares.

No one is allowed to use, steal, "borrow" or distribute that content without TonynUBares' permission.
